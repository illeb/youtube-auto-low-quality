## What?

This extension sets all your background youtube tabs at lowest quality.

## Why?

If you are like me who likes to listen to music from youtube playlists when working connected to a mobile hotspot, you will have probably stumbled in *youtube that sets your playing video at maximum quality or 720p*.

This usually results in wasting large amount of your data in a video you aren't watching anyway.

## Huh?

goto *What* section and read it again.
